# Integrity Monitoring System
I developed a custom proof-of-concept File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system that detects unauthorized changes to original files.

       * Established a baseline of target files and folders using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
       * Continuously compared the current state of files against the baseline and triggered alerts for any discrepancies.
       * Sent alerts through designated channels to facilitate further investigation of potential security breaches.
